## ESEP: Assignment 13: Data Processing and Storage Assignment

### How to Run the Code
To compile and run the InMemoryDB program on your system, follow these steps:
1. Ensure that you have a C++ compiler installed, such as g++. If you do not have g++ installed, you can download it from [GCC's website](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or install it via your operating system's package manager.
2. Clone this repository using gitclone https://github.com/Bencb03/Data-Processing-and-Storage-Assignment
3. Open the folder in a terminal or more preferably, VS code
4. Make sure you cd into the Data-Processing-and-Storage-Assignment folder
5. Compile the code with 'g++ -o database database.cpp' or if you have ' mingw32-make' installed, type make in the folder
6. Run the code with ./database
7. For steps 5 and 6, you could alternatively use vs code to run the program using this extension 'ms-vscode.cpptools' and using the run/debug feature on the left hand side. Be sure to select C++ as the language you are using.

### Suggestions for the Assignment
1. To make it easier to grade, create a uniform format for the assignment and make sure that everyone does it the same way so that an autograder can be used. 
2. Make more tests that we can just copy into our code in order to make sure our code works, or make us have our own tests and make this more of a project assignment.
3. Give us more detailed instructions on how all of the methods workl, along with more resources to help us accomplish this assignment.
4. Consider giving the starter code to us in a repository that we can fork, and then add comments to guide us along with the assignment. 
5. Make a new assignment showing us how to use VS code and the extensions as a prerequiste to make this one even easier.
